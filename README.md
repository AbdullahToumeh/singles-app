# Singles-app
Singles (sing and mingle) is a meteor-based application that was inspired by Tinder and designed for people who value talent and personality over looks. A user can upload a short record of him/her singing and other users can swipe right if they like the record or left if they don't. Eventually every user gets a chance to be matched with someone else based on their preferences.
